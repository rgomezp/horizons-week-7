# Pair programming exercise: Ho! Ho! Ho!

## Goal

Your goal is to create a simplified clone of the [Yo
app](https://www.justyo.co/). You'll build this app using React Native and run
it on the mobile platform of your choice, iOS or Android.

Your app will have the following features:

- Login/register
- Find friends who are already users (search by name, phone number, or email)
  and invite friends via email or SMS
- Invitees can accept invitations and the relationship is then established; they
  are invited to download the app, but can also "Ho! Ho! Ho!" the sender
  directly via the web from the link they received
- Tap on a friend's name in the app to "Ho! Ho! Ho!" them
