# Inline exercise: React Native intro
## Time limit: 10 minutes

## Goal

Your goal is to recreate the [simple counter app](https://github.com/horizons-school-of-technology/week06/blob/master/day3/warmup.md)
that we built last week using React, but this time using React Native.

## Instructions

Refresh your memory by re-reading the [project README](https://github.com/horizons-school-of-technology/week06/blob/master/day3/warmup.md)
for that project. You can also see a [live demo](http://s.codepen.io/lockehart/debug/grxrVL)
of that project.

You'll build this project on RNPlay, which is like Codepen but for React Native
apps. Use this RNPlay to get started: https://rnplay.org/apps/F3yMVA.

## Tips

- Remember, instead of `<div>`, use `<View>` to enclose your elements. This is
  already set up at RNPlay.
- *All text must* go inside a `<Text>` element!
- Instead of a `<button>`, use `<TouchableOpacity>`.
- Instead of `onClick`, use `onPress`. It works the same way.
