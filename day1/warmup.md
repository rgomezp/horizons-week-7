# Warmup: React Native
## Time limit: 15 minutes

## Goal

Your goal is to prepare to build React Native mobile applications. Exciting
right? Welcome to the wild world of mobile development.

## Instructions

Follow the instructions at [React Native: Getting
Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to
install the required components on your system and create your first mobile app.

For OS X users, this will include installing Xcode ([App Store
link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)). Xcode is very
large and takes a long time to install, so start the process now. If you want to
build and run Android apps, you should install Android Studio instead or in
addition to Xcode (see below instructions).

For Windows users, this will include installing [Android
Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) ([download instructions
here](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html)). Same story as above:
this is large and will take a long time to download and install, so start the
process now.
