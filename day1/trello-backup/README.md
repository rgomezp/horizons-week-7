# Pair programming exercise: Trello backup engine

## Goal

Your goal is to write a webapp that allows a user to backup a Trello board,
including all of its cards and metadata, to a Mongo database. The user can also
perform a restore operation, creating a new Trello board from the contents of a
Mongo database.

## Instructions

Recall the [Trello CSV
project](https://github.com/horizons-school-of-technology/week03/tree/master/day2/trello-csv)
from week 3. This project has several key differences:

- You're storing data in the database, rather than in a CSV file
- You're using OAuth to access the Trello API, rather than just a key
- You're using promises, glorious promises! This will make the async calls much
  easier.

Start with an `express` scaffold--feel free to use `express-generator` as in
past projects.

## Step 1. Trello authentication

trello-passport

## Step 2. Download the board

## Step 3. Write it to the database

## Step 4. Write back to Trello




## Bonus. Save to Google Drive
